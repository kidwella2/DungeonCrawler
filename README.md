# DungeonCrawler
The program is a text-based game that starts by getting the getting the player's name followed 
by the dungeon size. Magic spells and potions are determined by the dungeon size. There is one 
battle per room and the creatures are randomly spawned in each room. The player's turn is before 
the creatures and the player get to select from player options to determine an action. The game 
goes until the dungeon is cleared, the player dies, or the player quits. A few creatures have 
abilities that make them harder to beat.
